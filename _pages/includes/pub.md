[**Object-Aware SLAM Based on Efficient Quadric Initialization and Joint Data Association**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9829272), **Zhenzhong Cao**, Yunzhou Zhang, Rui Tian, Rong Ma, Xinggang Hu, Sonya Coleman, Dermot Kerr \| [**Project**](https://github.com/zhenzhongcao/Object-Aware-SLAM)

- We propose an efficient quadric initialization (EQI) method based on object detection and surfel construction which initializes quadrics using fewer frames with small viewing angles.
-  We propose a robust object-level joint data association (JDA) method combining multi-dimensional information and statistic distributions. 
- We propose a multi-constraint optimization factor graph for quadrics optimization and joint bundle adjustment.
- We implement a complete visual semantic SLAM system, aiming to build a novel object-oriented and semanticallyenhanced map for indoor robot interaction.

[**SemanticTopoLoop: Semantic Loop Closure With 3D Topological Graph Based on Quadric-Level Object Map**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02831), **Zhenzhong Cao** \| [**Project**](https://github.com/zhenzhongcao/SemanticToopLoop)

- MLV-ODA method is introduced to reduce the time and space complexity of data association, indirectly promoting the accuracy and completeness of object construction in the scene.
- QLT-SLC method is presented to improve the precision and recall rate of loop closure, as well as enhance the system's localization accuracy.
- The proposed MLV-ODA method and QLT-SLC method are embed into the Object-Aware SLAM system, which jointly maintain the PPO-MD.
- Qualitative experiments, quantitative experiments, and ablation studies are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MLV-ODA and QLT-SLC method.
